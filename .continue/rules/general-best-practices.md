description: This rule should be applied to all code regardless of language or
  technology stack. It establishes fundamental principles for writing
  high-quality code that's easy to maintain and understand.
---

Always write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Follow the principle of 'code is read much more often than it is written'. Use meaningful variable and function names. Keep functions small and focused. Add comments to explain complex logic. Follow consistent formatting and style guidelines. Write tests for your code. Optimize for readability and maintainability over cleverness. When in doubt, prefer explicit over implicit. Use version control effectively with meaningful commit messages.
